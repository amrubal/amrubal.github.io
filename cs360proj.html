<h1> Save the Bees by Angela Rubalcava </h1>


<pre>
   The fact that our planet is dying is no longer a faraway threat. 
   Countless ecosystems and necessary life on our planet has been 
   destroyed due to humanity’s need for more. Bee’s are currently 
   dying at an alarming rate and both our economy and ecosystem are 
   not prepared for a world without bees. I want to bring attention 
   to an issue that has been known for a while, but it is hard to 
   visualize the scale at which bee colonies are dying and why.  


  This project will be able to communicate the rate at which bees are
  dying and what is contributing to their demise through easy-to-read 
  charts and novel ways to engage the reader/viewer to care more about
  not just bees, but the well-being of our planet. In order to do this
  the project will include: 
   - An overview of the bee colony population in every state in the US 
   - Insight as to what variables/stressors have caused bee colonies to die
   - Compare bee colony population across different states 
        - Analyze states that have renovated and added colonies
        - Point out how renovations efforts help bee colony population
